Install vagrant:

>wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.8.5/vagrant_1.8.5.dmg

Be in this directory:

>vagrant up

The first time you do this, expect this to take 5-10 minutes.
It will end up with some red, but as long as it is just complaining about

../Tools/autotest/run_in_terminal_window.sh failing

that is fine.

Once up for the first time do:

>vagrant ssh-config > key.cfg

Now you can logon to the box:

>./login

Probably the first thing you need to do is:

echo '. /vagrant/bash_profile' >> ~/.bashrc

followed by

. ~/.bashrc


I have not installed maude, so you will need to do that.
Not sure how to do that programmatically.

Also you should test the sitl thingy:

cd ardupilot/ArduPlane
sim_vehicle.sh --console --map --aircraft test
