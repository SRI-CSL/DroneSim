On Mac OSX. before you start you need to be sure you have installed
Virtual box, Vagrant, and XQuartzâ‰¥

virtual box can be found at
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_2
OSX hosts
19dec04 the version is 5.2.34

vagrant can be found at
https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
macOs 64bit
19dec04 the version is  2.2.6

XQuartz can be found at
https://dl.bintray.com/xquartz/downloads/XQuartz-2.7.11.dmg


Be in this directory:

>vagrant up

this will do some configuring, then run the script in bootstrap.sh

The first time you do this, expect this to take 5-10 minutes.
It should end up saying

"Time to build/testing ardupilot"

When up for the first time do:

>vagrant ssh-config > key.cfg

Now you can logon to the box:

>./login

Once logged in for the first time, you will need to finish the
build of the arducopter:

sim_vehicle.py -v ArduCopter

Once built you'll have to ^D to exit.
Then should be able to launch via:

sim_vehicle.py -v ArduCopter --map --console

**** Fix to the error (timeout not correctly typed)
**** 19dec04 -- need to check if this needs to be done?

sudo pip2 install pymavlink==2.2.7
