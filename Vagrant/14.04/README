Install vagrant:

>wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.8.5/vagrant_1.8.5.dmg

Be in this directory:

>vagrant up

The first time you do this, expect this to take 5-10 minutes.
It should end up saying

"Time to build/testing ardupilot"

Once up for the first time do:

>vagrant ssh-config > key.cfg

Now you can logon to the box:

>./login

Once logged in for the first time, you will need to finish the
build of the arducopter:

sim_vehicle.py -v ArduCopter

Once built you'll have to ^D to exit.
Then should be able to launch via:

sim_vehicle.py -v ArduCopter --map --console

**** Fix to the error (timeout not correctly typed)

sudo pip2 install pymavlink==2.2.7
sudo pip2 install MAVProxy --no-deps
cp /vagrant/patch/mavproxy.py /usr/local/bin/mavproxy.py
