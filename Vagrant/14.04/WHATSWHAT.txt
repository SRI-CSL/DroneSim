"JSBSim is a multi-platform, general purpose object-oriented Flight
Dynamics Model (FDM) written in C++. Jon Berndt and Tony Peden began
about mid-1998 writing JSBSim. As of this writing it is the default
FDM for FlightGear. JSBSim can also be run in a standalone batch mode
for testing and study. More information on JSBSim can be found at the
JSBSim home page here:

"A UAV ground station software package for MAVLink based systems

This is a MAVLink ground station written in python.


MAVProxy is a fully-functioning GCS for UAV’s. The intent is for a
minimalist, portable and extendable GCS for any UAV supporting the
MAVLink protocol (such as the APM).  "

https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot   C/C++

"Ardupilot is the most advanced, full-featured and reliable autopilot
software available. It has been developed over 5+ years by a team of
diverse professional engineers and computer scientists. It is the only
autopilot software capable of controlling any vehicle system
imaginable, from conventional airplanes, multirotors, and helicopters,
to boats and even submarines. And now being expanded to feature
support for new emerging vehicle types such as quad-planes and
compound helicopters."

"The ArduPilot SITL (Software In The Loop) simulator allows you to
simulate an ArduPilot based autopilot and communicate with it using
MAVLink over the local IP network.

DroneKit-SITL is the fastest and easiest way to run SITL on Windows,
Linux, or MAC OSX. It is installed from Python’s pip tool on all
platforms, and provides a few simple commands to run pre-built vehicle
binaries that are appropriate for the host operating system
(downloading them if needed). You can even use it to run binaries
you've build locally.  "

"MAVLink micro air vehicle marshalling / communication library"


===================== Our description 

We use the python library DroneKit-SITL to communicate to a ArduPilot SITL instance.
The communication uses a MavProxy process that forwards MavLink
commands over the local IP network. 

The SITL (software in the loop) simulator allows us to simulate a Plane,
Copter or Rover without any hardware.
